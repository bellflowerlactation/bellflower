            Bellflower Lactation specializes in helping to identify, diagnose and treat <strong>Tethered Oral Tissues (TOTs)</strong>. Tongue, lip
            and buccal ties are types of tethered oral tissues that can have a significant impact on feeding and oral motor
            development. The diagnosis of a tongue, lip or buccal tie requires both an exam and a thorough functional assessment to
            understand the impact of the restricted tissues.

            As a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner and an IBCLC, I am uniquely suited to identify and diagnose TOTs while crafting an
            individualized care plan for your family. I have completed more than 75 hours of continuing education in TOTs and have
            developed close working relationships with many experts in the field to maximize care and outcomes for your family.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a thoughtful and comprehensive diagnosis has been made, I will then work in partnership with your family to 
            develop the best plan for you and your baby. This may include working with:
            
            <ul class="fleuron">
                <li>Pediatricians</li>
                <li>Pediatric dentists</li>
                <li>Chiropractors</li> 
                <li>Craniosacral therapists</li>
                <li>Occupational therapists</li>
                <li>Feeding therapists</li>
                <li>Speech language pathologists, etc.</li>
            </ul>
       
        </p>
        <p>
            Together we will develop a plan that will help you achieve your goals while considering the longer term impact of
            how tongue, lip and buccal ties can affect speech, sleep, oral development, behavioral development, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tongue, lip and buccal ties are often dismissed as:
            <em>“a fad”</em>,<em>“just a little string”</em> or <em>“baby’s gaining weight so, it’s not a problem”</em>.
            However, the impact can be significant and can affect the entire family unit in infancy and beyond.
            <strong>It is common for TOTs to be overlooked by pediatricians</strong>. Working with an infant feeding
            specialist (with additional training in TOTs) can validate your experience and have a tremendously positive impact
            on feeding and oral
            development.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know something <em>“just isn’t right”</em> with feeding or if you or one of your providers has suspected a
            tongue, lip or buccal tie for your baby, please reach out to <a href="https://bellflower.intakeq.com/booking">schedule an
            appointment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a parent of two children who were diagnosed with tongue ties in later childhood. These undiagnosed ties
            led to significant challenges and heartbreak when trying to breastfeed and bottle feed my babies. This deeply impacted my
            postpartum experience. I strive to listen to your story and to help identify the source of your feeding challenges
            on so we can work toward improved outcomes for the entire family.
