<p>At the end of every visit, I will provide you with a medical bill that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement (reimbursement is not guaranteed).</p>

<p>I accept all major credit cards and HSA/FSA cards through Square, Inc. To schedule an appointment you will need to enter your credit card information, but you will not be charged until the time of your visit. A $50 cancellation fee will be charged to your card if your appointment is cancelled with less than 24 hours notice.</p>
