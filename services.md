# Services

I am pleased to offer in-home visits as well as virtual follow-up and virtual prenatal visits. To provide the best care for your family, all initial visits after your baby’s birth are conducted in-home. I am currently observing recommended [COVID-19 precautions](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/prevention.html).

## Initial visits

Initial visits include a feeding plan designed for you and your family, assessment of baby’s weight, a follow-up phone call within 24 hrs, unlimited support via text or email for one week following the home visit and communication with your healthcare provider as appropriate.

## Follow-up visits and back-to-work consults 

| In-home visit (1 hr)  | $150 |
| Virtual visit (1 hr)  | $100 |

Follow-up visits and back-to-work consults are scheduled as needed following an initial in-home visit. They typically include: a detailed check-in on how things are going; continued monitoring of your baby’s weight; troubleshooting if necessary; and future planning (returning to work, maintaining milk supply, pumping/feeding schedules, etc.)

## Prenatal visits

| In-home visit (1 hr)    | $100 |
| Virtual visit (30 min)  | $50  |

Prenatal visits provide an opportunity to: get to know each other; answer your questions/concerns regarding feeding; help develop a feeding “game plan”; evaluate how to set up your home to make feeding easier; assist in choosing and learning how to use your breast pump and more.

## Billing details

At the end of every visit, I will provide you with a medical bill that you can submit to your insurance company, however reimbursement is not guaranteed.  

I accept all major credit cards and HSA/FSA cards via [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) where you can also [purchase a gift card](#)! When you [book an appointment](#) you will need to provide a credit card, but it won’t be charged until the time of your visit. 

__A $50 cancellation fee will be charged to your card if your appointment is cancelled with less than 24 hours notice.__
