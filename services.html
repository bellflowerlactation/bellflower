            Follow-up visits and back-to-work consults are scheduled as needed following an
            initial in-home visit. They typically include: a detailed check-in on how things are
            going; continued monitoring of your baby’s weight; troubleshooting if necessary; and
            future planning (returning to work, maintaining milk supply, pumping/feeding

            Complimentary virtual prenatal visits include a brief introductory video
            call to answer any questions/concerns you may have and to discuss working
