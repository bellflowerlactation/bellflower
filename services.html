            Follow-up visits and back-to-work consults are scheduled as needed following an
            initial in-home visit. They typically include: a detailed check-in on how things are
            going; continued monitoring of your baby’s weight; troubleshooting if necessary; and
            future planning (returning to work, maintaining milk supply, pumping/feeding
            schedules, etc.)

            Prenatal visits provide an opportunity to: get to know each other; answer your
            questions/concerns regarding feeding; help develop a feeding “game plan”; evaluate how
            to set up your home to make feeding easier; assist in choosing and learning how to use
            your breast pump and more.
