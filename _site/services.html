<p>I am pleased to offer in-home visits as well as virtual follow-up and virtual prenatal visits. To provide the best care for your family, all initial visits after your baby’s birth are conducted in-home. I am currently observing recommended <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/prevention.html">COVID-19 precautions</a>.</p>

      <td>$220</td>

      <td>Extra time (over 2 hrs)</td>
      <td>+$100/hour</td>

  </tbody>

<p>Initial visits include a feeding plan designed for you and your family, assessment of baby’s weight, a follow-up phone call within 24 hrs, unlimited support via text or email for one week following the home visit and communication with your healthcare provider as appropriate.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virtual visit (1 hr)</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Follow-up visits and back-to-work consults are scheduled as needed following an initial in-home visit. They typically include: a detailed check-in on how things are going; continued monitoring of your baby’s weight; troubleshooting if necessary; and future planning (returning to work, maintaining milk supply, pumping/feeding schedules, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="prenatal-visits">Prenatal visits</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>In-home visit (1 hr)</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Virtual visit (30 min)</td>
      <td>$50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Prenatal visits provide an opportunity to: get to know each other; answer your questions/concerns regarding feeding; help develop a feeding “game plan”; evaluate how to set up your home to make feeding easier; assist in choosing and learning how to use your breast pump and more.</p>

<h2 id="billing-details">Billing details</h2>

<p>At the end of every visit, I will provide you with a medical bill that you can submit to your insurance company, however reimbursement is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>I accept all major credit cards and HSA/FSA cards via <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en">Square</a> where you can also <a href="#">purchase a gift card</a>! When you <a href="#">book an appointment</a> you will need to provide a credit card, but it won’t be charged until the time of your visit.</p>

<p><strong>A $50 cancellation fee will be charged to your card if your appointment is cancelled with less than 24 hours notice.</strong></p>

            The bellflower signifies unwavering love, representing not only the way we feel about our babies,
            but also the steadfast compassion I believe all parents deserve on their personal breastfeeding 
            journeys.
