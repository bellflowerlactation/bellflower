    <h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>My name is Aemelia Tallen-Whited and I am a mother to three amazing girls (a singleton and one set of twins) and I personally understand the amazing highs and the frustrating lows of breastfeeding. I breastfed all three of my own girls, and each time, I was humbled by the challenges we faced and found tremendous pride in what we achieved.</p>

<p>As a board-certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, I’ve worked with parents and babies for many years, but my passion for breastfeeding truly began with the birth of my first daughter. I found breastfeeding first my singleton baby and then my twins to be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my daughters’ early years.</p>

<p>My own experience inspired me to develop my clinical skills to allow me to better help other families by providing evidenced-based lactation care. I understand the critical role feeding plays in a child’s first year of life and the impact that experience can have on our entry into parenthood.</p>

<p>In 2007, I graduated from Boston University with a Master’s of Public Health in International and Maternal and Child Health. I then went on to get my Master’s of Science in Nursing from Yale University in 2010. I have worked as a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner for 8 years, and while I no longer work in a clinic setting, I maintain my licenses and board-certifications as a Registered Nurse and a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner in the state of Minnesota.</p>

<p>I became an <a href="https://iblce.org/about-iblce/">International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC)</a> in 2016. I am also a member of the <a href="https://uslca.org/inside-uslca/">United States Lactation Consultants Association (USLCA)</a> and the <a href="https://ilca.org/about/">International Lactation Consultants Association (ILCA)</a>.</p>

<p>I live with my husband, 3 daughters and 2 small dogs in the Como neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota.</p>
