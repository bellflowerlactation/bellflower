    <h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>As a board-certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, I’ve worked with parents and babies for many years, but my passion for breastfeeding truly began with the birth of my first daughter. I found breastfeeding first my singleton baby and then my twins to be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my daughters’ early years. My own experience inspired me to develop my clinical skills to allow me to better help other families by providing evidenced-based lactation care. I understand the critical role feeding plays in our children’s first year of life and the impact that experience can have on our entry into parenthood.</p>

<p>In 2007, I graduated from Boston University with a Master’s of Public Health in International and Maternal and Child Health. I then went on to get my Master’s of Science in Nursing from Yale University in 2010. I have worked as a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner for 8 years, and while I no longer work in a clinic setting, I maintain my licenses and board-certifications as a Registered Nurse and a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner in the state of Minnesota. I became an International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) in 2016.</p>

<p>I am a mother to three amazing girls (a singleton and one set of twins), and I personally understand the amazing highs and the frustrating lows of breastfeeding. I breastfed all three of my own girls, and each time, I was humbled by the challenges we faced and found tremendous pride in what we achieved. I live with my husband, daughters and 2 small dogs in the Como neighborhood of Saint Paul.</p>
