<p>Bellflower Lactation provides evidenced-based, family-focused lactation care in the Greater Twin Cities area. I value breastfeeding as a feeding choice and focus on the promotion of the mental and physical wellbeing of the whole family. I do not push any specific feeding agenda and will work with you every step of the way to create a realistic and empowering feeding plan for your family. No matter how your family looks, where you live, what you believe or where you come from, it is my honor to work with you. I see the families I work with as partners in care, and I am honored and blessed to work with you at this amazing time in your family’s life.</p>
