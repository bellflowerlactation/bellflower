<p>Bellflower Lactation provides evidenced-based, family-focused lactation care in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.  I am an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and a Board Certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner. I value breastfeeding as a feeding choice and focus on the promotion of the mental and physical wellbeing of the whole family.</p>

<p>I do not push any specific feeding agenda and will work with you every step of the way to create a realistic and empowering feeding plan for your family. I strongly believe that our feeding journey is not a reflection of our success as parents or a measure of the love we have for our babies.</p>

<p>No matter how your family looks, where you live, what you believe or where you come from, it is my honor to work with you. I see the families I work with as partners in care, and I am honored and blessed to work with you at this amazing time in your family’s life.</p>
