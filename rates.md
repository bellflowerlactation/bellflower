# Rates

To provide the best care for your family, all initial visits (after baby’s birth) are conducted in-home. I am pleased to also offer in-home and virtual follow-up and prenatal visits.

## Initial Visit

Initial in-home visit (120 mins): $220

Includes a feeding plan designed for you and your family, assessment of baby’s weight, a follow-up phone call within 24 hrs, unlimited support via text or email for one week following the home visit and communication with your healthcare provider as appropriate.

Extra charges:
Additional baby (twins, triplets, etc.): $30/baby
After 2hrs additional time is charged at rate of $100/hr
There is an additional $1 per mile travel fee for visits outside a 20 mile radius of 55117

## Follow-Up Visits

Follow-up in-home visit (60 mins): $150
Virtual visit (60 mins): $100

Typically includes a detailed check-in on how things are going, continued monitoring of baby’s weight, trouble-shooting as necessary, future planning, etc. Scheduled as needed following an initial in-home visit.


## Prenatal Visits

Prenatal in-home visit (60 mins): $100
Prenatal virtual visit (30 mins): $50

This is an opportunity to get to know each other, answer your questions/concerns regarding feeding, help develop a feeding “game plan”, evaluate how to set up your home to make feeding easier, assist in choosing and learning how to use your breast pump, etc.

## Billing Details

At the end of every visit, I will provide you with a medical bill that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement (reimbursement is not guaranteed).  

I accept all major credit cards and HSA/FSA cards through Square, Inc. To schedule an appointment you will need to enter your credit card information, but you will not be charged until the time of your visit. A $50 cancellation fee will be charged to your card if your appointment is cancelled with less than 24 hours notice.
