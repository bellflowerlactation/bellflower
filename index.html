    <p>Bellflower Lactation provides evidenced-based, family-focused lactation care in the Twin Cities.
        I am an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and a Board Certified Pediatric Nurse
        Practitioner. I value breastfeeding as a feeding choice and focus on the promotion of the mental
        and physical wellbeing of the whole family.</p>
    <p>I do not push any specific feeding agenda and will work with you every step of the way to create
        a realistic and empowering feeding plan for your family. I strongly believe that your feeding
        journey is not a reflection of your success as parents or a measure of the love you have for your
        babies.</p>
    <p>No matter how your family looks, where you live, what you believe or where you come from, it
        is my honor to work with you. I see the families I work with as partners in care, and I am
        honored and blessed to work with you at this amazing time in your family’s life.</p>
