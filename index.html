    <p>
        Bellflower Lactation provides evidenced-based, family-focused lactation care in the
        Twin Cities. I am a <a href="https://iblce.org/about-iblce/">Board Certified Lactation Consultant</a> and a Board Certified
        Pediatric Nurse Practitioner. I value breastfeeding as a feeding choice and focus on the promotion of
        the mental and physical wellbeing of the whole family.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do not push any specific feeding agenda and will work with you every step of the way
        to create a realistic and empowering feeding plan for your family. I strongly believe that your
        feeding journey is not a reflection of your success as parents or a measure of the love you
        have for your babies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>No matter how your family looks, where you live, what you believe or where you come
        from, it is my honor to work with you.</em> The families I work with are partners in care,
        and I am honored and blessed to work with you at this amazing time in your family’s life.
