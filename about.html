        My name is Aemelia and I am a mother to three amazing girls (a singleton and
        one set of twins). I personally understand the amazing highs and the frustrating
        lows of breastfeeding. I breastfed all three of my own girls, and each time, I was
        humbled by the challenges we faced and found tremendous pride in what we achieved.

        As a board-certified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, I’ve worked with parents
        and babies for many years, but my passion for breastfeeding truly began with
        the birth of my first daughter. I found breastfeeding first my singleton baby
        and then my twins to be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences
        of my parenting journey thus far.

        My own experience inspired me to further develop my clinical skills to allow
        me to better help families by providing evidenced-based lactation care. I
        understand the critical role feeding plays in a child’s first year of life and
        the impact that experience can have on our entry into parenthood.

        In 2007, I graduated from Boston University with a Master’s of Public Health
        in International and Maternal and Child Health. I then went on to get my Master’s
        of Science in Nursing from Yale University in 2010. I have worked as a
        Pediatric Nurse Practitioner for 8 years, and while I no longer work in a
        clinic setting, I maintain my licenses and board-certifications as a
        Registered Nurse and a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner in the state of Minnesota.
